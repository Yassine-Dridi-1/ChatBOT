# ChatBOT
This project implements a chatbot that utilizes BERT, a powerful transformer-based model, along with similarity scoring using the sklearn library. The combination of these technologies enables the chatbot to provide accurate responses in various contexts.

Overview
This chatbot is designed to assist the chief information secuurity officer in obtaining relevant and real time information on a wide range of topics. It leverages the capabilities of BERT, which is pre-trained on a massive corpus of general text and fine tunned on SQuAD dataset, to understand and respond to CICO queries effectively.

Features
BERT Integration: Leverage the power of BERT to process and understand user queries effectively.

Similarity Scoring: Utilize sklearn to perform similarity scoring on input queries, ensuring that the most relevant responses are provided.
